1. Description

	This code is developed to infer the black hole mass (mbh) and stellar mass (mstar) by solving the two non-linear equations derived in Ryu+2020 () (Equations 9 and 10) assuming the main source of the observed bolometric luminosity is the heat dissipated by shocks near apocenter. The input is the spectral data (peak UV/optical luminosity, denoted by Lobs, and black body temperature at peak, denoted by T). For each candidate, the code tries to solve the equations using three different methods.
	
	1) It repeatedly computes Lobs and Tobs from logarithmically sampled mbh and mstar (within the range defined in the input file, bin size = N_sampling) and find the ranges of mbh and mstar yielding Lobs and Tobs within their uncertainties. The central values for the ranges for mbh and mstar are used as the first guess for the second method (solver1_LT). If the following two methods fail, the central values are given as the solutions.

	2) solver1_LT() : With the first guess, it computes mbh and mstar using the equations. It uses the mean value of the first guess and the first computed values to get the second values. It repeats this procedure until they converge simultaneously.

	3) solver2_LT() : 2-dimensional Newtonian-Raphson method.


2. Download and run

	To download, clone the git repository using HTTP access :

		https://github.com/taehoryu/TDE_mass_inference.git

	To run, you first enter the directory "TDE_mass_inference". In the directory, the code is run as

		Python3 main.py

	The code has two source dependencies : scipy and numpy

3. Units

	The default units are:

	- Luminosity(Lobs, Lobs_1, Lobs_2) = erg/s
	- Temperature (Tobs, Tobs_1, Tobs_2) = K
	- black hole mass (mbh) = 10^6msol (msol : solar mass)
	- stellar mass (mstar) = msol
 

3. Input data format

	Before running, you should prepare two input files in "input_file" directory:  one that contains the value of key parameters and  the other that contains the spectral data for the events that you are interested in. 
 

	1) model_info.txt : define key parameters. 
	
		- inputdata_file_name : the name of the input data file containing the spectral data of candidates
	        - output_file_name : the name of the output file with the inferred black hole and stellar mass. If "-" is given, the output file name is given with the candidate names: If there is one candidate in the input file, output_file_name = "candidate-name.out". If there are more than two, output_file_name = "(first-candidate-name)_(last-candidate-name).out" where "first-candidate-name" ("last-candidate_name") is the name of the first (last) candidate listed in the input data file
		- c1 : value of c_1 (the characteristic distance scale of the emission region in units of the apocenter distance of the most tightly bound debris). Defualt = 1
		- Del_omega : Solid angle (in units of pi) of radiation from the emission region. Default = 2.0
		- N_sampling : The number of bin in mbh (black hole mass) and mstar (stellar mass) to find the range of mbh and mstar for given Lobs and Tobs. It also determines the grid resolution of the contour plots produced as output. If N_sampling is small, it will produce output more quickly. N_sampling > 100 is suggested.


	2) input data file (the name is given in "model_info.txt")

		The code can handle two formats (".txt" or ".csv"). The input data file should consist of 11 columns:


			Candidate_name   mstar_min   mstar_max   mbh_min   mbh_max    Lobs    Lobs_1    Lobs_2    Tobs    Tobs_1    Tobs_2


		- Candidate_name : you can put any name here. This name does not affect the mass inference, but will simply be shown in solution figures (see 4. output).

		- mstar_min, mstar_max : These two define the range of stellar mass [mstar_min, mstar_max], in units of solar mass, within which the solvers try to find the solution. If the solutions are not found, you can increase the range and re-run the code. 

		- mbh_min, mbh_max : the range of black hole mass, in units of 10^{6} solar mass [mbh_min, mbh_max], within which the solvers try to find the solution. 

		- Lobs  : the peak luminosity in units of erg/s. 
		- Lobs_1, Lobs_2 : These two are determined by the uncertainties in Lobs. (IMPORTANT) Lobs - Lobs_1 and Lobs + Lobs_2 are the lower and upper limits for Lobs, respectively. For example, if log10(Lobs)=43_{-0.1}^{+0.1}, Lobs = 10^43, Lobs_1 = 10^{43}-10^{43-0.1} = 2.1*10^42 and Lobs_2 = 10^{43+0.1} - 10^{43} = 2.6*10^42. This definition applies to the uncertainties for Tobs, mbh and mstar.

		- Tobs : the black body temperature at the peak luminosity in units of K

		- Tobs_1, Tobs_2 : Same for Lobs_1 and Lobs_2. See the definitions for Lobs_1 and Lobs_2.


		The input.csv file in "example" directory has two examples. you can take copy and paste the file and put it in "input_file" directory

4. Output

	The code produces three different output files. All these output files are saved in "output" directory.

	1) text file with the inferred black hole mass for the candidates

		This output file consists of 13 columns. The first seven columns are identical to those in the input data file. The rest columns are the inferred black hole mass[mbh], its uncertainties [mbh_1,mbh_2], the inferred stellar mass [mstar] and its uncertainties[mstar_1,mstar_2]. The uncertainties for the inferred masses are defined the same way as those for Lobs and Tobs. The name of the output file is given in the "model_info.txt"

	2) solution figure on the mbh - mstar plane for each candidate

		The plots are created as many as the number of the candidates given in the input data file. There are two strips as long as the solutions are within the ranges of mbh and mstar set in the input data file. The blue strip demarcates the solutions for the given Lobs and the red strip for the given Tobs. The X-hatched green region indicates the solutions for the given Lobs and Tobs. 

	3) solution figure on the mbh - mstar plane for all candidates

		The name of the figure is  "c1_(c1_value)_del_omega_(del Omega value)_inferred_mass.png"
		"c1_value" and "del Omega value" are the values of c_1 and Del_omega, respectively.
		The error bars are determined to enclose the extreme values of the solutions.
